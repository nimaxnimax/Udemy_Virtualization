   - Set the subnet IP to `192.168.20.0` and the subnet mask to `255.255.255.0`.

4. **Configure DHCP Range:**
   - Set the DHCP start IP to `192.168.20.128` and end IP to `192.168.20.254`.

5. **Save Changes:**
   - Click `OK` to apply the configuration.

By following these steps, you have created an isolated network VMnet2, with its own DHCP server and IP address range, ensuring that VMs on this network cannot communicate with the external network or other VMnets unless specifically routed.

### Summary

Configuring the Virtual Network Editor in VMware Workstation Pro allows for robust network management and segmentation. By adding and configuring virtual networks, you can:

- Isolate networks for testing and security.
