Vagrant Example - Ubuntu VM

Below is an example of a `Vagrantfile` configuration for setting up a VirtualBox virtual machine with Ubuntu 22.04, allocating 2GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Define the virtual machine configuration
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"  # Ubuntu 22.04 (Focal Fossa) 64-bit box
  config.vm.hostname = "ubuntu-22"  # Hostname for the virtual machine

  # Configure hardware settings
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "2048"  # Allocate 2GB of RAM
    vb.cpus = 2         # Use 2 CPU cores
  end

  # Optional: Specify additional provisioning or configuration settings
  # Example:
  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  #   apt-get update
  #   apt-get install -y some-package
  # SHELL
end
```

To use this `Vagrantfile`:

1. Create a new directory for your Vagrant project.
2. Inside the directory, create a file named `Vagrantfile`.
3. Copy and paste the above configuration into the `Vagrantfile`.
4. Save the `Vagrantfile`.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `Vagrantfile`, and run `vagrant up` to start the virtual machine.

This configuration will create a VirtualBox virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04 with 2GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores. You can further customize the configuration to include additional provisioning or configuration settings as needed.

Another Vagrant Example for 3 VMs - Ubuntu

Here's an example `Vagrantfile` configuration to create three Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machines with 1 CPU and 1GB of memory each:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Loop to create three virtual machines
  (1..3).each do |i|
    config.vm.define "ubuntu-22-node#{i}" do |node|
      # Define the virtual machine configuration
      node.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"  # Ubuntu 22.04 (Focal Fossa) 64-bit box
      node.vm.hostname = "ubuntu-22-node#{i}"  # Hostname for the virtual machine

      # Configure hardware settings
      node.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.memory = "1024"  # Allocate 1GB of RAM
        vb.cpus = 1         # Use 1 CPU core
      end
    end
  end
end
```

To use this `Vagrantfile`:

1. Create a new directory for your Vagrant project.
2. Inside the directory, create a file named `Vagrantfile`.
3. Copy and paste the above configuration into the `Vagrantfile`.
4. Save the `Vagrantfile`.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `Vagrantfile`, and run `vagrant up` to start the virtual machines.

This configuration will create three VirtualBox virtual machines running Ubuntu 22.04, each with 1GB of RAM and 1 CPU core. The virtual machines will be named `ubuntu-22-node1`, `ubuntu-22-node2`, and `ubuntu-22-node3`, respectively. You can adjust the number of virtual machines and their configurations as needed.
