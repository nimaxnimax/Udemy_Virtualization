### Virtualization and Hypervisor Concepts

- **Virtualization**
  - Technique that allows multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical machine.
  - Enables efficient utilization of hardware resources.
  - Commonly used for creating virtual machines (VMs) to run different operating systems simultaneously.

- **Hypervisor**
  - Software layer that creates and manages virtual machines.
  - Sits between the hardware and the operating system to provide virtualization.
  - Ensures isolation and allocation of resources to each virtual machine.

- **Baremetal Hypervisor (Type 1)**
  - Installed directly on the physical hardware.
  - No underlying operating system; the hypervisor itself is the operating system.
  - Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
  - Provides better performance and efficiency due to direct access to hardware resources.

- **Hosted Hypervisor (Type 2)**
  - Runs on top of an existing operating system.
  - Less efficient compared to baremetal hypervisors due to an additional layer.
  - Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.
  - Easier to set up and use, suitable for desktops and development environments.

- **Conventional Server**
  - A physical server dedicated to running a single operating system.
  - Does not use virtualization.
  - All resources (CPU, memory, storage) are allocated to the single OS and its applications.
  - Offers simplicity but lacks the flexibility and resource optimization provided by virtualization.
