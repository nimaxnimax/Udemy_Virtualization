### Managing Azure Virtual Machines with Azure CLI

Azure CLI provides a powerful set of commands to manage Azure resources, including virtual machines (VMs). Below are some key commands to help you manage your Azure VMs, check the current VM list, and get more information about a specific VM (e.g., AZHVVM1).

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure CLI**: Ensure you have Azure CLI installed. You can install it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
2. **Sign In**: Log in to your Azure account using the following command:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
   This will open a browser window for you to enter your Azure credentials.

### Checking the Current VM List

To list all VMs in a specific resource group or across your subscription:

1. **List All VMs in a Subscription**:
   ```bash
   az vm list --output table
   ```
   This command lists all VMs in your subscription in a tabular format.

2. **List VMs in a Specific Resource Group**:
   ```bash
   az vm list --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --output table
   ```
   Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with the name of your resource group.

### Getting More Information about a Specific VM (AZHVVM1)

To get detailed information about a specific VM:

1. **Show VM Details**:
   ```bash
   az vm show --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1 --output json
   ```
   This command displays detailed information about the VM `AZHVVM1` in JSON format. Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with the appropriate resource group name.

2. **Get Instance View**:
   This provides the status of the VM, including power state and extensions.
   ```bash
   az vm get-instance-view --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1 --output json
   ```

3. **Get VM IP Addresses**:
   This command retrieves the public and private IP addresses of the VM.
   ```bash
   az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1 --output table
   ```

### Example Workflow

Let's go through an example workflow for managing VMs.

#### Step 1: List All VMs in a Subscription

```bash
az vm list --output table
```

#### Step 2: List VMs in a Specific Resource Group

```bash
az vm list --resource-group AZHVRG3 --output table
```

#### Step 3: Get Detailed Information about a Specific VM (AZHVVM1)

```bash
az vm show --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1 --output json
```

#### Step 4: Get Instance View of the VM

```bash
az vm get-instance-view --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1 --output json
```

#### Step 5: Get IP Addresses of the VM

```bash
az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1 --output table
```

### Conclusion

By using Azure CLI, you can efficiently manage Azure VMs, retrieve their status, and obtain detailed information. These commands help you automate and streamline your workflow, making it easier to manage resources within your Azure environment.


Using Azure CLI, you can start, stop, and shut down your Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) with simple commands. Below are the steps and commands to manage your VM (e.g., AZHVVM1) in these ways.

### Start a Virtual Machine

To start a VM, use the `az vm start` command:

```bash
az vm start --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
```

Replace `<ResourceGroupName>` with the name of your resource group where the VM resides.

### Stop (Deallocate) a Virtual Machine

To stop and deallocate a VM, use the `az vm deallocate` command. This action releases the hardware resources but retains the VM's configuration and data.

```bash
az vm deallocate --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
```

### Shutdown a Virtual Machine

Stopping (deallocating) and shutting down a VM are generally the same in the context of Azure CLI. However, if you want to perform a regular OS shutdown without deallocating the resources, you can use the `az vm stop` command:

```bash
az vm stop --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
```

This command shuts down the operating system of the VM, but unlike `deallocate`, it doesn't release the underlying compute resources. It is equivalent to turning off the machine's power.

### Example Workflow

#### Step 1: Start the Virtual Machine

```bash
az vm start --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1
```

#### Step 2: Stop and Deallocate the Virtual Machine

```bash
az vm deallocate --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1
```

#### Step 3: Shutdown the Virtual Machine (OS-level shutdown)

```bash
az vm stop --resource-group AZHVRG3 --name AZHVVM1
```

### Summary of Commands

- **Start a VM**:
  ```bash
  az vm start --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
  ```

- **Stop and Deallocate a VM**:
  ```bash
  az vm deallocate --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
  ```

- **Shutdown a VM (OS-level shutdown)**:
  ```bash
  az vm stop --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name AZHVVM1
  ```

### Notes

- **Start**: Boots up the VM and makes it available for use.
- **Stop (Deallocate)**: Shuts down the VM and releases the hardware resources, reducing costs.
- **Stop (Shutdown)**: Shuts down the VM's operating system but does not release the hardware resources, which continues to incur compute costs.

Using these commands, you can efficiently manage the state of your Azure VMs through the Azure CLI.


### Hyper-V Virtual Switch Manager

The Hyper-V Virtual Switch Manager is a feature in Microsoft Hyper-V that allows you to create and manage virtual switches. These virtual switches enable virtual machines (VMs) to communicate with each other and with external networks. 

### Types of Virtual Switches

1. **External Virtual Switch**:
   - **Description**: Connects VMs to a physical network. VMs connected to an external switch can communicate with each other and with the external network (including the internet).
   - **Use Cases**: When VMs need to access external network resources or be accessible from outside the host.
   - **Example**: A VM that needs internet access or to be accessed by other devices on the physical network.

2. **Internal Virtual Switch**:
   - **Description**: Allows communication between VMs on the same host and between VMs and the host itself, but not with the external network.
   - **Use Cases**: Useful for test environments or when VMs need to communicate only with each other and the host without needing external network access.
   - **Example**: A development environment where multiple VMs need to interact with the host machine but not the internet.

3. **Private Virtual Switch**:
   - **Description**: Allows communication only between VMs on the same host. The host cannot communicate with the VMs, and the VMs cannot communicate with external networks.
   - **Use Cases**: Highly secure environments where VMs need to be isolated from the host and external networks.
   - **Example**: Testing environments where VMs should be completely isolated for security reasons.

Remove-VMSnapshot -Name "CheckpointName" -VMName "VMName"
```

Using these commands and steps, you can effectively manage checkpoints in Hyper-V, ensuring you can capture and restore VM states as needed.


### What Does it Mean to Export and Import VMs in Hyper-V?

**Exporting a VM**:
- Exporting a VM in Hyper-V involves creating a copy of the virtual machine's configuration, virtual hard disks, and snapshots, and saving them to a specified location. This process generates a set of files that can be used to recreate the VM on the same or a different Hyper-V host.

**Importing a VM**:
- Importing a VM involves taking the exported VM files and using them to create a new virtual machine instance in Hyper-V. During the import process, you can choose how to handle the unique ID of the VM and its configuration, which determines whether you are registering, restoring, or copying the VM.

### Why Export and Import VMs in Hyper-V?

**Benefits and Use Cases**:

1. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - **Backup**: Exporting VMs provides a method for backing up entire virtual machines, including their configuration and data. This ensures you have a copy to restore in case of data loss or corruption.
   - **Disaster Recovery**: In the event of a system failure or disaster, you can import the exported VMs on a new Hyper-V host to quickly resume operations.

2. **Migration**:
   - **Move to New Host**: Exporting and importing VMs is a straightforward method to migrate VMs from one Hyper-V host to another, especially when moving to new hardware or a different data center.
   - **Cross-Environment Migration**: Useful for migrating VMs between different environments, such as from a test environment to a production environment.

3. **Cloning**:
   - **Create Duplicates**: By exporting a VM and then importing it with a new unique ID, you can create a clone of the VM. This is useful for setting up multiple identical environments, such as for testing or development purposes.

4. **Testing and Development**:
   - **Safe Testing**: Export a VM, make experimental changes to the imported VM, and if something goes wrong, you can revert by re-importing the original VM.
   - **Consistent Environments**: Developers can export their working VMs and share them with other team members to ensure consistency across development environments.

5. **Templates and Provisioning**:
   - **VM Templates**: Create a VM template by configuring a VM with necessary settings and software, then export it. You can import this template multiple times to quickly provision new VMs with the same configuration.

### Detailed Steps for Exporting and Importing VMs

**Exporting a VM**:

1. **Using Hyper-V Manager**:
   1. Open Hyper-V Manager.
   2. Select the VM you want to export.
   3. In the Actions pane, click on "Export".
   4. Choose a destination folder where the exported files will be saved.
   5. Click "Export".

2. **Using PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   Export-VM -Name "VMName" -Path "C:\Path\To\Export"
   ```

**Importing a VM**:

1. **Using Hyper-V Manager**:
   1. Open Hyper-V Manager.
   2. In the Actions pane, click on "Import Virtual Machine".
   3. Browse to the folder where the VM was exported.
   4. Follow the wizard to complete the import process, selecting the appropriate options (register, restore, or copy).

2. **Using PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   Import-VM -Path "C:\Path\To\Exported\VM"
   ```

**Import Type Options**:
- **Register the Virtual Machine in-place (use the existing unique ID)**: Use this if you want to use the VM exactly as it was without creating new copies of the VM’s configuration files.
- **Restore the Virtual Machine (use the existing unique ID)**: Creates a new instance of the VM with a new copy of its configuration files, keeping the same unique ID.
- **Copy the Virtual Machine (create a new unique ID)**: Makes a clone of the VM with a new unique ID and new copies of its configuration files.

### Summary

Exporting and importing VMs in Hyper-V provides a flexible method for backup, migration, cloning, testing, and templating. It ensures VMs can be easily moved, duplicated, and restored, supporting a variety of scenarios from disaster recovery to development and testing environments. These capabilities enhance the management and scalability of virtualized environments.
